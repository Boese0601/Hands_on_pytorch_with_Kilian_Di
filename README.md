# Eat torch within 7 days

## Introduction

This repository is used to strengthen my ability to reproduce models in torch.

The models I created may vary from those in the original paper or torchvision.models.

So please be careful.



Also I made some comment to the code so that it would be more easier for amateurs to get in touch with Deep Learning.

For more materials related to torch and deep learning,please refer to [this link](https://github.com/Boese0601/Lee-Hung-Yee-DLML).

Or [this one](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html).



Good Luck!
